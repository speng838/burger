This is a full stack site about burgers.

To run this in visual studio code, first navigate to server.js and open it. Install all the packages and proceed to enter 'node server.js' in terminal.

Afterwards go to your browser and enter 'localhost8080.' You have the option of naming a burger of your choice. Once the burger is named, press "place order" and the burger name will move under "Ready to eat!." 

Once the burger is under "Ready to eat!," you will have the option to click "devour it," which would then move the burger to the left side of the screen to "Already eaten".

All the code has been carefully written and below is the link to the deployed version in heroku.
